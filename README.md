# **Project Overview**

In this project, we'll predict the winner of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL).

## **Project Steps**

- Clean the data and get it ready for machine learning using pandas.
- Make predictions about who will win a match using scikit-learn.
- Measure error and improve our predictions.
- Propose ways to continue the project.

## **Project Results**
- Developed an initial predictive model with variable accuracy for forecasting team victories.
- Enhanced the model's performance by implementing a rolling averages method, achieving a 15% increase in precision.
- Demonstrated that when the model forecasted a win for one team while predicting either a draw or a loss for the opposing team, precision improved by an additional 5%.
